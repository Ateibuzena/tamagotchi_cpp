# tamagotchi_cpp
Tamagotchi project in C++ that simulates a virtual pet by managing its hunger, energy, and happiness. It uses the ncurses library to display an interactive text-based interface where the user can feed, play with, and put the pet to sleep as time passes. The game ends when the pet dies due to neglect or when the user chooses to exit.
